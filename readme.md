# Method Draw

Method Draw is a web based vector drawing application. The purpose of Method Draw is to provide a simple and easy-to-use SVG editor experience. It purposely removes some features such as layers and line-caps/corners in exchange for a more simple and pleasant experience. If you are looking for a more complete vector editing open-source solution, please check out [SVG Edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit).
