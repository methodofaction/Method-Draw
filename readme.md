The purpose of Method Draw is to provide a simple and easy-to-use SVG editor experience. It purposely removes some features such as layers and line-caps/corners in exchange for a more simple and pleasant experience. If you are looking for a more complete vector editing open-source solution, please check out SVG Edit [SVG Edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit).

## Development

Develop and run a local web server under `src`;

```
cd src
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Build

Install dev dependencies:

`npm install`

Then you can build into `dist` by running:
